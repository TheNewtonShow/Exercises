    <h2>Featured Review</h2>
    <p><b>Stephen King's best adapted movie</b>
        I have never seen such an amazing film since I saw The Shawshank Redemption.
        Shawshank encompasses friendships, hardships, hopes, and dreams. And what is so
        great about the movie is that it moves you, it gives you hope.
        Even though the circumstances between the characters and the viewers are quite
        different, you don't feel that far removed from what the characters are going
        through.
        King is one of the best writers in the world. Books like IT and the Castle Rock
        series are some of the greatest stories ever told. But his best adaptations are
        always done by the best directors. The Shining was brilliantly interpreted by
        Kubrick and of course the aforementioned Misery and Stand By Me are both by Rob
        Reiner. Now Frank Darabont comes onto the scene and makes arguably the best King
        film ever. He seems to understand what King wants to say and he conveys that
        beautifully.
        What makes this film one of the best ever made is the message it conveys. It is one
        of eternal hope. Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins, has been sent to prison for
        a crime he did not commit. But he never loses hope. He never gives up his quest to
        become a free man again. His years of tenacity, patience and wits keep him not only
        sane, but it gives his mind and a spirit a will to live. This film has a different
        feel to it. There has never been anything like it before and I don't know if there
        will again</p>
